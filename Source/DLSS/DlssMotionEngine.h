// CDlssStabilizer
//
// Steadies DLSS 5 NR over time without touching the network. Only its change to
// the picture, output - input, is filtered over time and then added to the current
// frame, so the video itself is never delayed -- the EFFECT variant of
// Shaders/d3d11/ps_dlss_stabilize.hlsl. The history is clamped to the current
// neighbourhood, so a wrong motion estimate cannot drag old content far.
//
// Motion comes from NVIDIA Optical Flow, run at about 540 lines whatever the video:
// the history follows the picture, so moving areas are steadied too. Or from the
// shader detector (CDlssMotionMask), which steadies only what stands still.
//
// Measured in tools/dlssnr_probe --tstab on real pictures with known motion: plain
// DLSS shows 1.44x to 1.59x the low-frequency flicker of its input; with Optical
// Flow 1.06x to 1.14x, with the whole effect kept.
