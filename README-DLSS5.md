# DLSS 5 Neural Rendering & Frame Generation for MPC Video Renderer

A fork of [Aleksoid1978/VideoRenderer](https://github.com/Aleksoid1978/VideoRenderer) that adds
an optional NVIDIA **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering** pass (NGX feature 18) to the Direct3D 11
video pipeline, with a temporal stabilizer made for video, an experimental option to
enlarge the picture with **DLSS Super Resolution** (NGX feature 1) instead of the resize
shaders, and **DLSS Frame Generation (DLSS-G)** (NGX feature 2) for 2×, 3×, and 4× frame rate
interpolation.

Neither neural pass is a denoiser. Feature 18 **reconstructs the picture**: it rebuilds detail and
edges, and what it takes out of the grain and the compression noise is a consequence of that,
not the job it was given. DLSS Super Resolution, in the 4.5 DLLs this was built against,
rebuilds the picture as it enlarges it and comes out **cleaner than the source**: it takes
about 70 % of the film grain out over time, and on compressed film it lands above Catmull-Rom
on moving pictures. **DLSS Frame Generation** doubles, triples, or quadruples the frame rate
for high-refresh displays via an internal D3D11-to-D3D12 interop bridge. Which features you want,
and whether they suit your films, is your call: all are optional and off by default.

The renderer stays a Direct3D 11 filter. Nothing about its existing pipeline changes when
the features are off, and the rendering is bit-identical to upstream in that state.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX (RTX 40-series recommended for Frame Generation). Developed and tested on RTX 3050 & RTX 40-series |
| OS | Windows 10 1703 or later (shared NT fences), x64 only |
| Player | MPC-BE or any DirectShow player that lets you force a renderer |
| DLSS 5 NR DLL | `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` — **not included, see below** |
| DLSS-G DLL | Optional: `nvngx_dlssg.dll` for Frame Generation — **not included, see below** |
| Optical Flow | `nvofapi64.dll`, installed with the NVIDIA driver (RTX 20 series and later). Used for stabilizer motion vectors and optical flow guides |
| DLSS Super Resolution | Optional: `nvngx_dlss.dll` 310.5 or later (DLSS 4.5), from the public [NVIDIA/DLSS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS) repository (`lib/Windows_x86_64/rel`). Developed with 310.9.1 |

### The DLLs are not in this repository

`nvngx_dlssnr.dll` and `nvngx_dlssg.dll` are NVIDIA's property and are not redistributable,
so they are not here and will not be.

You supply them yourself. The filter looks for them, in order:

1. the path set in the property page, if any
2. next to `MpcVideoRenderer64.ax`
3. `<filter directory>\dlss\`
4. one and two directories above the filter

The **DLSS 5** property page has browse fields for each DLL (`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`, `nvngx_dlss.dll`,
and `nvngx_dlssg.dll`). For Frame Generation, the UI offers 2×, 3×, and 4× multipliers as well as
a "Show only interpolated frame" visual debug mode.

## Building

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git
```

If you forgot `--recursive`: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Requirements: **Visual Studio 2022** with the **C++ MFC for v143 build tools (x86 & x64)**
component. Upstream declares `UseOfMfc`, and MSBuild enforces it even though no source
actually includes MFC.

```
build_mpcvr.cmd NoWait
```

Outputs `_bin\Filter_x64\MpcVideoRenderer64.ax` and, beside it,
`_bin\Filter_x64\dlss\nvngx.dll` — a small shim of ours, described below. Register the
filter with `distrib\Install_MPCVR_64.cmd`.

## How it works

Four things had to be solved. All of them were settled by measurement, not documentation —
there is none for this feature.

**The D3D11 backend of the snippet is inert.** It exports a complete D3D11 surface —
`Init_Ext`, `CreateFeature`, `EvaluateFeature`, an `NGXCubinD3D11` class, NVAPI cubin calls —
and every one of them returns `FAIL_FeatureNotSupported`. During nine init attempts with
different argument shapes the snippet issued *zero* NVAPI queries, so it is not a driver
gap: it refuses before asking the driver anything, and before initialising its own logging.
The D3D12 path, on the same device in the same process, works.

So `CDlssNR` builds a **private D3D12 device** on the same adapter (matched by LUID). The
renderer keeps allocating its textures on D3D11; they carry an NT share handle and are
opened a second time on the D3D12 side. Synchronisation is CPU-side in both directions —
see `Source/DLSS/DlssNR.h` for why that is deliberate.

**The snippet refuses unknown callers.** It walks back to the calling module and rejects
anything whose path does not contain `nvngx.dll`, returning `0xBAD00002` and logging
"Not called from NGX runtime". `NgxShim/` builds a small `nvngx.dll` of forwarders that the
guarded entry points are called through. It must not be tail-call optimised, or the return
address is the caller's again and the check fails from inside the shim.

**The architecture check.** The snippet asks NVAPI for the GPU architecture in
`NGXCubinGeneric::SetGPUArch` and refuses anything below its own declared minimum
(`0x1B0`, Blackwell). `CDlssNR` hooks `NvAPI_GPU_GetArchInfo` with MinHook and reports the
minimum the snippet itself declares — nothing is invented. It has to be installed before
the snippet loads, because the value is read once during init and cached. The spoofed answer
goes only to calls made from `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` itself: every NGX snippet asks the same
question, and DLSS Super Resolution told it runs on Blackwell picks kernels an Ampere or Ada
card cannot run, writes nothing and removes the device.

**Video has no motion vectors and no depth.** The network runs colour-only at
`ScalingRatio 1.0`: `DLSSNR.Depth` is never set, and `DLSSNR.MVec` only when the stabilizer is
asked to pass its Optical Flow vectors on. Left unset, the DLL's own log confirms it runs
that way (`EvaluateFeature Color=... MVec=0000000000000000 Depth=0000000000000000`). Vectors
alone do not buy temporal stability — see the next section.

Other findings worth knowing: the SDK version must be **0x13** (the driver core rejects
anything newer with `FAIL_OutOfDate`), the driver's NGX core does not know feature 18 at all
so the snippet must be loaded directly, and the working set is about **500 MB of video
memory at 1080p**, growing with resolution.

---

## Temporal stabilizer

The network blends each frame with its own previous output (`CC_Control_History_Blend`,
`dlssnr_prev_output`). A game keeps that history aligned with motion vectors; video has
none, and the result is a luminance shimmer: on real pictures, plain DLSS shows about 1.5×
the low-frequency flicker of its own input. The temporal suites of the harness (below)
measured what this DLL does with its inputs:

- **Motion vectors do not realign the history.** Their convention could be found (pixels,
  current to previous, scale 1), but once the history is in use, correct, inverted and absent
  vectors measure the same. Given as `DLSSNR.MVec`, Optical Flow vectors cut the flicker only
  part of the way and change the rendering around moving objects. Depth changes nothing.
- **Left alone, the history does nothing measurable**: it measures the same as no history.
- **`DLSSNR.ControlMask` steadies, but it strips the effect.** It weighs the history per
  pixel, and with any mask bound only 10 % (mask at 1) to 36 % (mask at 0, a frozen picture)
  of the network's change to the picture is left (`--teffect`, on a photo). The first version
  of this stabilizer drove that mask from a motion detector; in the player it looked exactly
  like DLSS turned off. DLSS5-Reshade-AIO leaves the parameter unused as well.

So the stabilizer works **after** the network and never touches its inputs
(`Source/DLSS/DlssStabilizer.cpp`, `Shaders/d3d11/ps_dlss_stabilize.hlsl`):

1. **Only the effect is steadied.** The network's change to the picture, E = output − input,
   is filtered over time and added back to the current input. The video itself is never
   delayed, so a cut or fast motion cannot leave a ghost of the picture — at most of the
   enhancement.
2. **The history is clamped** to the range of E in the current 3×3 neighbourhood, ± 0.02, so a
   wrong motion estimate cannot drag old values far.
3. **Motion** comes from one of two sources, chosen on the page:
   - **NVIDIA Optical Flow** (default): forward and backward flow from the driver's
     `nvofapi64.dll`, computed at about 540 lines whatever the video (4×4 grid, medium
     quality). The history is moved along the vectors, so moving areas are steadied too. A
     vector is trusted according to its forward/backward consistency, its matching cost, and
     how well the previous input, moved along it, matches the current one; where trust falls,
     the network's output for that picture is used as it is.
   - **Shader detector**: the four passes of the first version (`ps_dlss_motion.hlsl`) at a
     quarter of the resolution, with a noise floor measured on the video, a dilation and an
     8-picture hold. It has no vectors, so it steadies only what stands still.

   If Optical Flow cannot start (a GPU older than RTX 20, an old driver) or keeps failing,
   the detector takes over; the statistics and the page's status line say which one runs.
4. **Optionally**, the Optical Flow vectors also go to the network as `DLSSNR.MVec`.

Only a new picture moves the history on. A redraw — paused video, the OSD, a change that
brings no new picture — is steadied again against the same history as its picture, so it
shows what changed without taking a second step.

Measured on a photo with grain and 8×8 block noise, 1920×1080 windows moving with known
motion (`--tstab`, default network settings, RTX 3050). Flicker is the frame-to-frame change
of blurred luma, compensated by the true motion, as a ratio to the input's; *effect* is how
much of plain DLSS's change to the picture is left:

| | Still | Slow pan | Pan | Moving object | Cut | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plain DLSS | 1.44× | 1.59× | 1.56× | 1.49× | 1.47× | 100 % |
| **Stabilizer, Optical Flow** | 1.06× | 1.11× | 1.14× | 1.09× | 1.06× | 100 % |
| Stabilizer, shader detector | 1.02× | 1.55× | 1.56× | 1.12× | 1.13× | 100 % |
| Stabilizer, true motion (the ceiling) | 1.02× | 1.04× | 1.04× | 1.04× | 1.02× | 100 % |
| Vectors to DLSS, no stabilizer | 1.22× | 1.29× | 1.29× | 1.22× | 1.23× | 97–100 % |
| Vectors to DLSS + stabilizer | 1.00× | 1.03× | 1.05× | 1.02× | 1.01× | 96–100 % |

With Optical Flow the stabilizer removes about 80 % of the flicker DLSS adds, moving content
included, and stays within 0.0005 of plain DLSS on average (0.0013 on edges and where the
object moved). Passing the vectors to the network as well steadies a little more, but the
network then renders differently: 0.0032 away from plain DLSS where the object moved, 2.5
times the stabilizer alone — which is why that box is off by default. A variant filtering the
whole output, TAA-style, was measured too and dropped: it steadies more by also smoothing the
video itself, its grain and its edges.

Checked in the harness (`--tstabport`): the filter's own class, with its shaders embedded as
in the filter, measures exactly what the reference passes measure — every sequence, every
motion source, vectors to DLSS included — and each of 285 redraws shows, bit for bit, what
its picture showed.

Cost on an RTX 3050 (`--tstabbench`, GPU time per picture):

| Working size | Optical Flow | of which flow and vectors | Shader detector |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1920×1080 | 2.8 ms | 2.2 ms | 0.8 ms |
| 3840×2160 | 5.5 ms | 3.0 ms | 2.9 ms |

The CPU side stays under half a millisecond: nothing waits for the GPU. Memory: about 95 MB
at 1080p — the history, two input copies and the result at the working size — and 375 MB at
2160p, plus the Optical Flow engine's own buffers. With the stabilizer at 0, nothing is
allocated and nothing runs.

The detector itself was validated against a perfect motion map on synthetic sequences
(`--tdetect`): no lag on fades and slow pans, no added smear around moving objects, and
repeated pictures (variable frame rates, 25p stored as 50p) handled like the perfect map.

## DLSS Super Resolution (experimental)

**Use DLSS SR 4.5 for upscaling (Experimental)**, on the DLSS page, enlarges the picture with
DLSS Super Resolution instead of the **Upscaling** method of the main page, which is then
greyed. It is independent of DLSS 5 NR: another DLL, another session, and it works with NR on
or off. When NR runs before upscaling, SR takes its output.

**How it runs.** Unlike the NR snippet, this feature runs on Direct3D 11 through the display
driver's NGX runtime (`_nvngx.dll`), which loads `nvngx_dlss.dll` itself: no second device,
no shared textures, no waits (`Source/DLSS/DlssSR.cpp`). Every call into NGX runs in a
separate device context state, so NGX's compute bindings never reach the renderer's passes;
the harness checks that the renderer's own resize gives the same picture, bit for bit, before
and after an evaluation. Several things were settled by measurement: the runtime's
`NVSDK_NGX_D3D11_Init_Ext` works (its plain `Init` answers `OutOfDate` once a current snippet
is on the path, and `Init_ProjectID` with the documented argument order crashes), and its
`Shutdown1(device)` crashes where `Shutdown()` ends the session cleanly, leaves an NR session
in the same runtime working, and allows a new one.

**Inputs.** Video has no jitter and no depth: the input is the picture at its own size, the
depth a constant plane, and the motion vectors come from NVIDIA Optical Flow at about 540
lines, run on the very picture DLSS enlarges — after DLSS 5 NR when that runs — and cleaned up
as described below. A redraw gets no vectors. The quality mode follows the scale (Quality
below ×1.6, Balanced below ×1.85, Performance below ×2.5, Ultra Performance above) and DLSS
picks the model for it unless a preset is set: with 310.9.1, **M** at ×2, **L** at ×3, **K**
below.
Past ×4 DLSS stops there and the resize shaders do the rest; where the picture does not grow
on both axes, or no feature can be made for a size, the Upscaling method runs as before.

**Still backgrounds and the edges.** DLSS resamples its history along the vectors it is given,
and Optical Flow's raw vectors are wrong on a still, grained picture: most blocks by a fraction
of a pixel in every direction, some by several pixels, and worst along the frame's edges, where
a block has no neighbours on one side. A still background shimmered like heat haze, and the
grain stayed in a band along the edges, where vectors leaving the picture made DLSS drop its
history. The vectors now go through two passes before DLSS
(`Shaders/d3d11/cs_dlss_global_motion.hlsl`, then PASS 4 and PASS 3 of `ps_dlss_stabilize.hlsl`,
`CDlssStabilizer::ForDlssSR`):

- **the picture's global motion**: the median of the blocks that can be trusted — forward and
  backward flow agree, the match is good, the vector stays in the picture — exact to the
  engine's 1/32 of a pixel, measured on the GPU with nothing waiting for it. The median of all
  blocks is not enough: on heavy grain the flat areas, where only the grain changes, give a
  coherent wrong motion that moved it 0.6 to 4 pixels on four film frames out of six. Under 0.4
  pixels the global motion counts as none;
- **each block** keeps a motion of its own only if it lies more than 0.75 to 1.5 pixels from the
  global motion and the trusted blocks around it share it (see *Moving subjects* below);
  otherwise it takes the global motion. A block pointing out of the picture where the global
  motion does not is noise as well.

A still background thus gets exactly no motion, a pan exactly the pan, and what moves on its
own keeps its vector. `--tsrstill` measures it on six 4K film frames, each halved and grained
anew on every frame, then enlarged twice: 40 still frames, an object crossing them, a slow pan
(0.7 pixel a frame) and a pan (3.8 pixels a frame). *Shimmer* is how much the structures of a
still picture move from one frame to the next, *grain flicker* how much the grain left does,
both ×1000 on luma; PSNR in dB.

| | Light grain | | | | Old film grain | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vectors | Shimmer | Grain flicker | Slow pan | Pan | Shimmer | Grain flicker | Slow pan | Pan |
| Raw (up to 1.2) | 1.44 | 1.61 | 48.4 | 48.3 | 3.05 | 3.51 | 42.6 | 42.7 |
| Snapping alone (first version) | 0.73 | 0.95 | 49.9 | 50.3 | 1.84 | 2.12 | 43.6 | 44.7 |
| **Now** | **0.74** | **0.92** | **50.2** | **50.3** | **1.81** | **2.13** | **43.9** | **44.9** |
| Exact (not available in playback) | 0.96 | 1.00 | 53.3 | 53.6 | 1.85 | 1.80 | 44.5 | 47.1 |

The shimmer falls to the level of exact vectors, or under it, and pans gain 1 to 2 dB. Along
the edges, the raw vectors were off by 8.5 pixels on light grain and 21 pixels on old film grain
in the outermost 4 pixels, and left 18 to 24 % more grain there than exact ones; now 0.3
pixel, and 2 to 4 % more grain. With exact vectors DLSS keeps a slight edge effect of its
own: on one film frame, a 32-pixel guard band — the picture mirrored on every side — took a
further 7 to 10 % off the grain flicker in the outermost band and left the grain as it was; not
worth 9 % more DLSS time, so there is none. The filter's passes match the same computed on the
CPU, on still, panned and zoomed pictures: the global motion exactly, the vectors to their
texture's precision, 0.016 pixel (`--tsrport`).

**Moving subjects.** What moves on its own kept Optical Flow's vector, and its error with it:
on a subject crossing a still background, the vectors DLSS got were off by 1.4 pixels (RMS) on
light grain and 2.2 on old film grain, and under heavy grain the engine also underestimates the
motion itself, by 0.4 to 0.8 pixel of 2.9, the same way on every block. The subject shimmered
as a still background did with the raw vectors. PASS 4 now cleans what keeps its own motion,
one block at a time:

- Optical Flow reads a flow frame boxed a little wider — 4×4 source pixels per flow pixel at
  1080p instead of 2×2 — which takes grain out of what it matches;
- each block climbs from its own vector to the motion the trusted blocks around it share: a
  mean shift over the 7×7 blocks around it, weighted by trust and by closeness to within a
  pixel, so that the background, a pixel or more away, never joins in. It keeps that motion if
  at least four blocks' worth of trust, and a tenth to a third of the window's, share it;
- where the picture has texture, the kept vector is searched again on the two flow frames, in
  steps of a half, a quarter and an eighth of a flow pixel, which undoes the engine's bias;
- then it is blended with the vector found one picture earlier where the content came from,
  when the two agree (0.3 for the new one).

| | Light grain | | | Old film grain | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vectors | Subject shimmer | Subject PSNR | Pan shimmer | Subject shimmer | Subject PSNR | Pan shimmer |
| Raw (up to 1.2) | 1.72 | 45.0 | 1.46 | 3.14 | 41.5 | 3.10 |
| Snapping alone (first version) | 1.78 | 44.8 | 0.73 | 3.20 | 41.7 | 1.35 |
| **Now** | **0.75** | **46.2** | **0.66** | **2.30** | **42.3** | **1.19** |
| Exact (not available in playback) | 0.29 | 45.7 | 0.14 | 0.93 | 42.3 | 0.49 |

*Shimmer* is the same measure taken on what moves, against the frame before at the place it
came from: the subject inside its outline, the pan away from the edge it enters by. The subject
shimmers 2.4 times less on light grain and 28 % less on old film grain than with the first
version, its PSNR reaches that of exact vectors, and its vectors are off by 0.9 and 1.8 pixels;
pans shimmer 10 % less and gain up to 0.3 dB. What it costs: on still pictures under old film
grain, DLSS keeps 3 % more grain than with the snapping alone (5 % in the outermost 8 pixels)
and the picture measures 0.3 dB lower; on light grain nothing changes, and the edges come out
slightly cleaner. A few false motions still survive on flat areas of a still picture, where any
offset matches. What was tried to take them out — weighing each block's say by its texture,
checking each kept vector against the frames, requiring the same motion two pictures running,
asking a larger share of the window — took moving subjects' motion away as well, or cost the
slow pan under heavy grain, and was left out. Subjects still shimmer more than with exact
motion, chiefly under heavy grain, where a block of low contrast cannot tell its own motion from
the grain's: hence *Experimental* on the option.

**Cost** on an RTX 3050 6 GB (`--tsr`, GPU time per frame):

| Source → output | Mode, preset | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 1920×1080 → 3840×2160 | Performance, M (default) | 23.3 ms |
| same | preset J / K / L | 10.1 / 11.2 / 31.6 ms |
| 1280×720 → 3840×2160 | Ultra Performance, L (default) | 17.2 ms |
| 1920×800 → 3840×1600 | Performance, M | 16.3 ms |
| 1920×1080 → 2560×1440 | Quality, K | 4.2 ms |

Add the vectors, 3.0 ms at 1080p in playback, and up to about 3.6 ms on a zoom, where every
block moves its own way and is searched again: Optical Flow both ways with the matching cost,
then the passes described above. The snapping alone took 2.2 ms; up to 1.2 the raw vectors took
1.3 ms, and nothing when DLSS 5 NR lent its own; DLSS SR now always makes its own.

**Quality — read this before turning it on.** `--tsrq` pans windows of six 4K film frames by
half a source pixel per frame, reduces them to the source, grains or compresses them per
frame, and measures every method against the reference it never saw. Averages over the six
frames (PSNR in dB; *grain* is the fine detail left in flat areas, the source keeps about 2.4):

| | Clean, still | Clean, moving | Grain left | Compressed, still | Compressed, moving |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Catmull-Rom | **55.9** | **55.9** | 2.40 | **46.9** | **46.8** |
| Lanczos3 | 54.7 | 54.7 | 2.55 | 46.5 | 46.4 |
| **DLSS SR, Optical Flow vectors** | 51.8 | 52.7 | **0.68** | 46.5 | **48.3** |
| DLSS SR, no vectors | 51.8 | 49.2 | 0.45 | 46.5 | 45.3 |
| DLSS SR, exact motion (not available in playback) | 51.8 | 54.3 | 0.45 | 46.5 | 49.7 |

With the vectors a player can compute, DLSS SR stays **less faithful than Catmull-Rom on
clean film**, 3 to 4 dB below. On compressed film it is level with it on still pictures, 0.4 dB
below, and **1.5 dB above on moving ones**: where the source carries compression noise, the
reconstruction is worth more than the fidelity it costs. It also **takes about 70 % of the film
grain out** over time, and the grain it leaves flickers 3.5 times less (0.68 against 2.40).
That degraining and denoising is what DLSS 4.5 gives a film beyond the enlargement, and on a
grainy source it is what you will notice first.
The cleaned vectors gain 0.3 to 1.2 dB on still pictures and 2.7 to 3.0 dB on moving ones over
the raw vectors of 1.2 (50.6, 49.7, 0.73, 46.2 and 45.5 on the row above), and remove a little
more grain. Without jitter a still picture gives DLSS
nothing new, and Optical Flow is not precise enough for it to accumulate as much detail on a
pan as exact motion does: finer flow — the source size, a vector per pixel, the slowest search —
measured no better. The option is therefore off by default and marked experimental; your eyes
decide whether its cleaner look is worth it on your films.

## Upscaling: FSRCNNX, RAVU-zoom and ArtCNN

The main page's **Upscaling** and **Chroma upsampling** lists are ordered by what they measured,
best first, on 1080p film brought to 4K. Six of the entries enlarge one plane with a small
network instead of a filter kernel, the way mpv's prescalers do:

| Entry | What it is | 1080p→4K luma, RTX 3050 |
|---|---|---|
| **ArtCNN C4F16 DS** | ArtCNN C4F16 DS: four convolution layers in compute passes, doubles. Cleans grain and compression as it enlarges | 14.5 ms, 63 MB |
| **RAVU-zoom** | RAVU-Zoom-AR r3: trained edge-directed weights, to any size at once, anti-ringing inside the kernel | 3.9 ms, no extra texture |
| **FSRCNNX 16 AR** | FSRCNNX_x2_16-0-4-1, 16 feature maps, doubles, with anti-ringing | 18.0 ms, 190 MB |
| **FSRCNNX 8 AR** | FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1, the same with 8, with anti-ringing | 5.9 ms, 95 MB |
| **FSRCNNX 16**, **FSRCNNX 8** | the same two without anti-ringing | the same |

The colour comes from Catmull-Rom, which enlarges the picture as usual; the network's luma
then replaces its own, by adding the difference to R, G and B alike, so chroma is untouched.
Where the picture grows by more than the doubling (720p on a 4K screen) the resize shaders
finish the job, and where it grows by less they reduce what the network doubled, as mpv does.
Below 1.3× FSRCNNX and ArtCNN do not run at all, and RAVU-zoom needs the picture to grow on
both axes; the statistics then name Catmull-Rom, which is what runs. They need Direct3D 11 at
feature level 11.0 (the passes are shader model 5, ArtCNN's in compute); on Direct3D 9, on
older hardware, and while DLSS Super Resolution is enlarging the picture, Catmull-Rom stands
in.

### Anti-ringing

A network asked to double a picture invents an edge steeper than the one it was given, and
overshoots past it — the bright fringe along a dark line. **AR** takes that back the way
libplacebo does inside its own kernels: the value is pulled towards the range the four source
samples around that point really cover, four fifths of the way. RAVU-zoom carries this in its
own kernel already, which is what the AR of its upstream name means; FSRCNNX and ArtCNN do not,
so the list offers the two FSRCNNX entries both ways and you can hear the difference in the
`halo` column below. It costs nothing measurable in time, about a seventh of a decibel of
detail on clean film, and two hundredths of the sharpness.

### What each one is worth: luma

Ten 4K film frames reduced by 2 or by 3, degraded the way a source is, then enlarged again
(`dlssnr_harness --tupscale`), plus the doom9 line-art test. PSNR on the most detailed quarter
of the picture, against Catmull-Rom; `halo` is how far the output overshoots the range the
reference really covers along its edges, so lower is better and 0 is a kernel that cannot ring.

| Method | 1080p→4K | grain | compressed | 720p→4K | line art | halo | time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ArtCNN C4F16 DS** | −1.36 dB | **+1.37 dB** | **+0.38 dB** | +0.20 dB | **+2.92 dB** | 0.00028 | 14.5 ms |
| **RAVU-zoom** | +1.56 dB | +0.58 dB | +0.20 dB | +1.58 dB | +0.65 dB | **0.00002** | 3.9 ms |
| **FSRCNNX 16 AR** | +2.02 dB | +0.31 dB | −0.02 dB | +2.27 dB | +2.43 dB | 0.00005 | 18.0 ms |
| **FSRCNNX 8 AR** | +1.58 dB | +0.15 dB | −0.11 dB | +1.96 dB | +1.98 dB | 0.00005 | 5.9 ms |
| **FSRCNNX 16** | **+2.18 dB** | +0.23 dB | −0.12 dB | **+2.65 dB** | +1.76 dB | 0.00023 | 18.0 ms |
| **FSRCNNX 8** | +1.72 dB | +0.03 dB | −0.22 dB | +2.28 dB | +1.01 dB | 0.00020 | 5.9 ms |
| Catmull-Rom | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.00000 | 0.9 ms |
| Lanczos2 | +0.04 dB | −0.02 dB | −0.01 dB | +0.05 dB | +0.01 dB | 0.00000 | 0.9 ms |
| Mitchell-Netravali | −1.98 dB | −0.16 dB | −0.15 dB | −1.50 dB | −0.40 dB | 0.00000 | 0.8 ms |
| Lanczos3 | −1.23 dB | −0.66 dB | −0.43 dB | −0.42 dB | −0.04 dB | 0.00005 | 1.2 ms |
| Jinc2m | −3.48 dB | −2.65 dB | −1.75 dB | −1.02 dB | +1.61 dB | 0.00039 | 2.6 ms |

How to read it. **A clean 1080p master** is where FSRCNNX 16 wins and ArtCNN DS loses, because
ArtCNN is a denoiser as much as an upscaler and a clean reference has nothing to clean: it
takes real detail with the noise. **A real film** — grain, and compression on top — is the
other way round: ArtCNN DS gains a decibel on everyone else, because it is the only one that
does not amplify what the encoder left behind (it keeps grain at 0.43 of the reference's, the
others push it to 2.2). **Line art** wants a network, any network, and Catmull-Rom is the floor.
**Jinc2m**, the filter's old default, is last on film everywhere and rings four times harder
than anything else; it earns its place only on drawn lines.

So: **ArtCNN C4F16 DS** if your films are grainy or heavily compressed and you have the 14 ms,
**RAVU-zoom** if you want most of the gain for a quarter of the time and no ringing at all,
**FSRCNNX 8 AR** if you want the sharpest edges per millisecond, **FSRCNNX 16 AR** if the time
does not matter. If you would rather keep the grain than have it cleaned, stay away from
ArtCNN DS and take FSRCNNX or RAVU-zoom.

### What each one is worth: chroma

**Chroma upsampling** has three entries beyond the kernels. **Jinc (EWA)** is the polar kernel
madVR and mpv call Jinc: jinc(d) windowed by a jinc, cut at 3.2383 — the third zero, mpv's
`ewa_lanczos`. It is not separable, so it reads a disc of about 32 texels around each point
rather than a row and a column; chroma sits at a fixed place among the luma pixels, so the
weights of the four possible positions are worked out when the conversion shader is generated
and the shader only adds texels up. **RAVU-zoom** and **FSRCNNX 8 AR** instead put Cb and Cr
through an mpv prescaler, each plane on its own and placed where the video's chroma siting puts
it (MPEG-2, co-sited or centred). All three want Direct3D 11 and 4:2:0 in planes; elsewhere —
4:2:2, the hardware video processor without the box below, Direct3D 9 — Catmull-Rom does it.

Measured through the filter itself, on six 1080p film frames played as 4:2:0 with the chroma
sited where video puts it and compared with the same frame in 4:4:4 (`playback_test --chroma`),
plus the doom9 line-art test. PSNR of Cb and Cr over the picture, then along the luma's edges,
where bleeding shows and where the eye looks:

| Method | Cb/Cr | at luma edges | whole picture | line art, at edges | what it costs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jinc (EWA)** | **+0.22 dB** | **+0.61 dB** | **+0.20 dB** | +0.25 dB | about 32 texels a pixel, in the conversion shader |
| **RAVU-zoom** | −0.05 dB | +0.47 dB | −0.08 dB | +1.89 dB | a pass of its own, 2.4 ms at 1080p |
| Catmull-Rom | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 texels a pixel |
| **FSRCNNX 8 AR** | −0.32 dB | −0.21 dB | −0.35 dB | **+2.28 dB** | a pass of its own, 4.0 ms at 1080p |
| Bilinear | −0.29 dB | −0.73 dB | −0.26 dB | −1.55 dB | one bilinear fetch |
| Nearest-neighbor | −1.75 dB | −2.94 dB | −1.68 dB | −3.30 dB | one fetch |

Film and drawn lines want opposite things here, and the list is ordered for film, as asked.
**Jinc** is the one to take: it is the only method above Catmull-Rom on both the colour itself
and the colour along edges, it shifts nothing, and it stays inside the conversion shader, which
reads about thirty-two texels a pixel for it instead of Catmull-Rom's sixteen — it never cost a frame
in any of the tests here. **RAVU-zoom**
gains almost as much on edges but half a tenth of a decibel of overall colour, and leaves the
one-tenth-of-a-level offset every luma-trained network leaves on a chroma plane. **FSRCNNX 8
AR** is below Catmull-Rom on film — a network trained on luma has no business guessing colour
from a photograph — and the best of all of them on drawn lines by a wide margin, which is why
it is in the list at all: it is the entry for animation.

Two methods the study measured and the filter does **not** offer: **KrigBilateral** collapses
on line art (−6.7 dB) and is under Catmull-Rom on film; **CfL Prediction** wins only the
synthetic case where chroma is a linear function of luma, which no real film is. **NGU**, the
one that beats everything on the doom9 test, is closed.

The **defaults are unchanged**: Upscaling is Jinc2m and Chroma upsampling Catmull-Rom for a
fresh installation, and settings already saved in the registry are left alone — each entry
carries its own number, so reordering the lists moved nobody's setting.

The statistics show what they cost, next to the DLSS lines:

    Prescale (ms) : FSRCNNX 16 8.4, RAVU-zoom chroma 1.9

Only what runs is listed. When the hardware video processor handles the source format it
converts the picture itself, chroma included, so the **Chroma upsampling** list has nothing to
do and no chroma line appears; the processor line says so:

    VideoProcessor: D3D11 VP, output to R10G10B10A2_UNORM, converts chroma

The main page greys a list that is out of service for that reason, on what the filter is
actually doing: **Chroma upsampling** while the video processor converts, **Upscaling** and
**Downscaling** while it also resizes (*Use for resizing*, which DLSS 5 NR and DLSS SR suspend
on their own), and **Upscaling** while DLSS SR enlarges. A list that a Dolby Vision or YCgCo
picture sends back to the shaders stays available.

**Replace VP chroma upsampling**, under the list, moves that one job to the shaders without
taking the picture away from the processor. A compute shader reads the planes of a progressive
4:2:0 or 4:2:2 frame, rebuilds Cb and Cr with the method above, and writes the result back in
4:4:4 — AYUV on an 8-bit source, Y410 on a 10-bit one — which the processor then converts and
resizes as it always did. It is the shader video processor's own conversion code, generated as
a compute shader instead of a pixel shader, so both paths stay the same picture.

Measured on a 4K film frame halved, played as 4:2:0 and as 4:4:4 through the same conversion
(`playback_test --chroma` and `--chroma10`): PSNR of Cb and Cr over the picture, then next to
the luma's edges where bleeding shows, and the constant shift of Cb and Cr in 8-bit levels.

| Source | Chroma | Cb/Cr | At luma edges | Colour shift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8-bit (NV12) | the video processor | 52.25 | 48.69 | 0.07 level |
| | **Catmull-Rom before it** | **52.86** | **49.60** | **0.07 level** |
| | **RAVU-zoom before it** | **53.30** | **50.18** | **0.10 level** |
| | **Jinc before it** | **53.66** | **50.72** | **0.07 level** |
| | Catmull-Rom, shaders alone | 53.38 | 50.05 | 0.02 level |
| 10-bit (P010) | the video processor | 49.60 | 47.76 | 0.68 level |
| | **Catmull-Rom before it** | **55.24** | **51.68** | **0.05 level** |
| | **RAVU-zoom before it** | **55.96** | **52.75** | **0.08 level** |
| | **Jinc before it** | **56.61** | **53.51** | **0.06 level** |
| | Catmull-Rom, shaders alone | 55.71 | 51.85 | 0.01 level |

The processor's own chroma comes out between Nearest and Bilinear: 5.6 to 7.0 dB under the
shaders on a 10-bit film, 3.9 to 5.8 dB along its edges. On a 10-bit source it also
shifts the colour by about seven tenths of a level: its driver reads the studio range as
16/255 to 235/255 whatever the depth, while a 10-bit signal runs from 64/1023 to 940/1023. The
shaders read it at its own scale and write the 4:4:4 picture back on the scale the driver
expects, so that shift goes away as well — worth more here than the chroma itself. What is
left between the pre-pass and the shaders alone is the 8- or 10-bit picture handed over.

The processor keeps the picture, so what only it can do keeps applying, with one change each
way (`tools/dlssnr_probe` `vp444_probe`, which measures how much enabling an extension changes
the picture, in 8-bit levels):

- **RTX Video HDR** goes on working, and on a 10-bit source it starts working: the driver
  leaves a 10-bit 4:2:0 picture untouched (0.000) and tone maps the same frame in 4:4:4 as it
  does an 8-bit one (37.7 against 37.9). The filter therefore stops asking for it on a 10-bit
  4:2:0 picture, where it never did anything, and the statistics no longer claim it. On a
  10-bit film the box is thus what gives RTX Video HDR something to work on: untick it and the
  HDR line loses it, tick it again and it comes straight back, with the film still playing;
- **Super Resolution** does nothing to a 4:4:4 picture (0.000, against 4.0 on 4:2:0), so it is
  not requested for the pictures this moves and the statistics do not claim it either;
- **deinterlacing** works on NV12 only on this driver, so interlaced video keeps the
  processor's own chroma; 4:4:4 and RGB sources have no chroma to rebuild and are left alone;
- **HDR passthrough** is unaffected: the processor answers that it converts a PQ picture in
  AYUV, Y410 or Y416 to PQ RGB just as it does one in NV12 or P010 (`vp444_probe --hdrconv`).

The statistics say which is happening, and why when the option does not apply:

    VideoProcessor: D3D11 VP, output to R10G10B10A2_UNORM, chroma by shaders: Catmull-Rom
    VideoProcessor: D3D11 VP, output to B8G8R8A8_UNORM, converts chroma (interlaced)

The box needs Direct3D 11 and costs the chroma pass, a few tenths of a millisecond at 1080p
(RAVU-zoom, which enlarges Cb and Cr through its own shader first, costs about 3 ms).

Render ahead (below) covers them as well: with FSRCNNX 16 or ArtCNN a 4K picture takes more than the 8 ms
the renderer allows itself, and without it the picture would reach the screen late.

The shaders come from mpv's user-shader collections and are translated to HLSL once, offline:
`Shaders/mpv/mpv_shaders.py` runs each pass through glslang and SPIRV-Cross — the route
libplacebo itself takes on Direct3D 11 — and writes `Shaders/mpv/<shader>/passNN.hlsl`, the
lookup tables as half floats, the table `Source/Upscale/MpvShaderTables.h` and the generated
blocks of `compile_shaders.cmd` and `MpcVideoRenderer.rc2`. `Source/Upscale/MpvShader.cpp` runs
them the way libplacebo does: each pass renders — or, for ArtCNN, dispatches — into a texture
of the size its WIDTH and HEIGHT give, reading the plane, what earlier passes saved and the
tables. A compute pass writes through unordered access slot 0, the one slot feature level 11.0
always gives a compute shader. `--tmpvport` checks that this gives the harness's pictures
exactly, to the last half float, and that the chroma siting is applied.

---

## Render ahead

The renderer wakes up 8 ms before a picture's time and only then processes it, so whatever
the DLSS passes take beyond those 8 ms used to reach the screen late. The renderer's own *Sync
offset* on an RTX 4060: −7 ms without DLSS, +11 to +17 ms with DLSS 5 NR, +11 to +19 ms with
DLSS 5 NR and DLSS SR — and DLSS SR's GPU time comes on top, since the GPU runs it after
Present has returned. The delay also varied by several ms from picture to picture, enough to
move some pictures to the next refresh of a 60 Hz screen.

**Render ahead to keep audio sync** (Settings page, on by default) measures each picture from
the start of its processing to the GPU being done with it, and starts the next pictures earlier
by the slowest of the last 32 plus 3 ms. Each picture then waits, while the GPU finishes it,
for the moment the renderer presents at without DLSS: half a refresh before its time, on the
reference clock. Presentation stays on the audio clock. It never waits for the GPU itself: a
picture not finished at its present time is presented anyway, reaches the screen once the GPU is
done, as it would have without render ahead, and moves the start earlier. It does nothing while
neither DLSS nor a luma prescaler runs, and a picture cannot start before the previous one has
been presented: about a frame earlier at most, never more than 60 ms.

Measured in a DirectShow graph with the filter itself (`playback_test.exe`): an 800×450 film in
a 1280×720 window on an RTX 3050 and a 60 Hz screen, with DLSS 5 NR and DLSS SR (NR 23 ms,
stabilizer 1.6 ms, SR 3.2 ms), 20 s per run. Sync offset, mean (5th…95th percentile), and
skipped pictures:

| Film | Render ahead off | Render ahead on |
|---|---|---|
| 23.976 fps | +15.1 ms (+14…+16), 0 skipped | **−6.4 ms (−7…−6)**, 0 skipped |
| 29.97 fps | +17.1 ms (+16…+19), 0 skipped | **−6.5 ms (−7…−6)**, 0 skipped |
| 59.94 fps, more than this GPU can do | +20.2 ms, 707 skipped | +19.9 ms, 707 skipped |

Without DLSS the same film measures −7.2 ms (−8…−6). A first version waited for the GPU before
presenting; at 29.97 fps that took the time from the next picture and skipped 25 of them in
20 s. At 29.97 fps most pictures are counted *late* below: the GPU finishes DLSS SR a moment
after the present time, because the source cannot hand over a picture earlier than a frame
minus its own time. Render ahead does not make the chain faster than the video: at 50 or 60 fps
with DLSS 5 NR pictures are still skipped, as they were.

The statistics show where the time goes and what render ahead does:

    DLSS (ms)     : NR 23.0, stabilizer 1.7, SR 3.3
    Render ahead  : 34 ms (ready in 29.8, max 30.6), late 10

*ready in* is the whole picture, from the start of processing to the GPU being done: the mean
and the slowest of the last 32. *late* counts pictures the GPU had not finished at their present
time. A few at start-up are normal; a count that keeps growing means the chain barely fits the
frame rate, and a lighter DLSS SR preset gives it room. DLSS 5 NR is timed where the renderer
waits for it, the other stages with GPU timestamps while the statistics are shown.
*Times(ms): Present* includes the wait.

## Settings

Everything lives on the **DLSS** page of the renderer's properties (x64 builds only) and is
stored under `HKCU\Software\MPC-BE Filters\MPC Video Renderer`. Render ahead is the exception:
it serves the luma prescalers as much as DLSS, so it sits on the **Settings** page, where the
32-bit builds reach it too. Its registry key, `DlssRenderAhead`, did not change.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enable | off | Forces 16-bit float internal textures |
| Apply after upscaling | off | Runs at display resolution instead of source. Much heavier at 4K |
| Toggle key | F12 | Toggles during playback. The filter swallows this key |
| DLL | empty | Empty means search the locations listed above |
| Style | Default | Default / Natural / Cinematic. Applies live |
| Preset | 0 | **No effect with the DLL builds seen so far** — they ship a single network and every preset falls back to it |
| Auto mask | on | |
| Intensity | 1.50 | |
| Local tone | 0.30 | Low on purpose: the local terms amplify frame-to-frame variation |
| Local struct. | 0.50 | |
| Skin struct. | 0.90 | |
| Stabilizer | 100 | 0–100. Where the history is trusted, the current picture weighs from 1 down to 0.25 at 100, the measured setting. 0 runs nothing. Applies live |
| Motion | NVIDIA Optical Flow | Or *Shader detector (still areas)*. Applies on the next picture |
| Send the motion vectors to DLSS | off | Optical Flow only. Steadier, but the network renders differently around moving objects |
| Disable temporal history | off | Forces `DLSSNR.Reset` every frame. The stabilizer is not affected |
| Use DLSS SR 4.5 for upscaling (Experimental) | off | See above: not perfect yet. Greys the main page's Upscaling list while it is on |
| Preset (DLSS SR) | Automatic | Or J, K, L, M. Applies on the next picture |
| DLL (DLSS SR) | empty | `nvngx_dlss.dll` or its folder. Empty means search next to the filter and up |

On the **Settings** page, bottom right:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Render ahead to keep audio sync | on | See above. Used while DLSS 5 NR, DLSS SR or a luma prescaler runs. Needs Direct3D 11 |

In the **Shader video processor** box, the two lists are ordered best first (see *Upscaling*
above) and each entry keeps its own number, so a setting already saved still means what it did:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Upscaling | Jinc2m | ArtCNN C4F16 DS, RAVU-zoom and the four FSRCNNX entries enlarge the luma with a network; AR holds what it invented to the range the source covers. Needs Direct3D 11; Catmull-Rom stands in elsewhere and while DLSS SR is enlarging |
| Chroma upsampling | Catmull-Rom | Jinc (EWA) is the best of them on film and stays inside the conversion shader; RAVU-zoom and FSRCNNX 8 AR put Cb and Cr through an mpv prescaler, FSRCNNX being the one for drawn lines. All three need Direct3D 11 and 4:2:0 in planes |

And under the Chroma upsampling list:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Replace VP chroma upsampling | off | See above. The shaders rebuild the chroma of a progressive YUV 4:2:0/4:2:2 picture with the Chroma upsampling method and hand the video processor a 4:4:4 one, so RTX Video HDR goes on working and starts working on 10-bit sources. Interlaced video keeps the processor's chroma, and Super Resolution does not apply to 4:4:4. Needs Direct3D 11 |

**Default** on the DLSS page resets the tuning, from Style to Disable temporal history, motion
settings and the DLSS SR preset; it leaves Enable, Use DLSS SR, the key, both DLL paths and
render ahead, which belongs to the Settings page, alone. Applying the page sends only what was
changed on it, so it never undoes the toggle key or the main page, and the main page leaves
these settings alone.

The feature is also reachable programmatically through `IExFilterConfig`:
`Flt_SetBool("dlssNR", true/false)` and `Flt_GetBool("dlssNR", &b)`. `Flt_GetString("statsText")`
returns the statistics as they are drawn on the picture, for tools that log them.

---

## Known limitations

**Some shimmer remains.** With Optical Flow about 1.1× the input's flicker is left on moving
content, and the shader detector leaves moving areas as the network rendered them. Lowering
**Local tone** and **Local struct.** still helps, which is why they default low.

**Where Optical Flow is unsure** — large flat or dark areas, occlusions, transparency — trust
falls and those pixels get the network's output for that picture alone. The clamp keeps any
mistake within the local range of the effect.

**Motion the detector misses.** In detector mode, motion finer than the noise over nearly
flat areas can go undetected, and the steadied effect then lags behind it. Use Optical Flow,
or lower the stabilizer.

**Memory.** ~500 MB of VRAM at 1080p for DLSS, more at higher resolutions, plus a 159 MB
module resident while the session is up. The stabilizer adds about 95 MB at 1080p and 375 MB
at 2160p, plus what the Optical Flow engine allocates.

**Cost.** Two CPU stalls per frame for the cross-device synchronisation, plus the network
itself and the stabilizer. Fine for video framerates; this is not a low-latency design. Render
ahead keeps pictures on time as long as a picture takes less than about a frame.

**Settings change while the film plays.** They all take effect on the picture that follows,
with no restart: the formats the processor may take, RTX Video HDR, Super Resolution, the
chroma of the list and the box that moves it. One case used to freeze the picture with the
sound still running -- anything that stopped HDR output, RTX Video HDR unticked first among
them -- and it was not what it looked like: HDR output needs the modern presentation model,
*Swap effect: Discard* asks for the older one, and Windows never takes a window back to it.
The swap chain then presented every picture, in time and without error, while the screen kept
the last one. A window that has carried the flip model now keeps it, which shows everything
the old model showed. `playback_test --toggle` watches the desktop itself for exactly this.

---

## Diagnostic tools

`tools/dlssnr_probe/` holds four programs; `build.cmd` builds them.

**`dlssnr_probe.exe`** — talks to the snippet directly and reports what it says about
itself: caller validation, the parameter vtable layout, `GetFeatureRequirements`, which
NVAPI entry points it resolves and which the driver refuses, and a full D3D12
create/evaluate cycle. Useful on a new GPU, a new driver or a different DLL build.

```
dlssnr_probe.exe                 report only, nothing altered
dlssnr_probe.exe --spoof-auto    report the architecture the DLL asks for
dlssnr_probe.exe --spoof 1B0     report a specific architecture id
```

**`dlssnr_harness.exe`** — compiles `Source/DLSS/DlssNR.cpp` and the renderer's own
`Tex2D_t` against a real D3D11 device and runs 300 frames with toggles, resolution changes
and preset changes, then a teardown with work in flight. Not a mock: it is the filter's
code. Run it before putting a build in a player.

```
dlssnr_harness.exe --frames 300
```

It should end with `0 check(s) failed`.

Its temporal suites measure the network on sequences whose true motion is known, and write
their tables next to the program. Run them from `tools/dlssnr_probe`: the reference passes
compile the shaders from `Shaders/d3d11`, and `build.cmd` also embeds them the way the filter
does, so the filter's own classes (`DlssMotionMask.cpp`, `DlssOpticalFlow.cpp`,
`DlssStabilizer.cpp`) run unchanged.

```
dlssnr_harness.exe --temporal     motion vector conventions, depth, history
dlssnr_harness.exe --tmask        ControlMask values on still and moving content
dlssnr_harness.exe --toracle      a perfect motion map as the mask
dlssnr_harness.exe --tdetect      the shader detector against that map

dlssnr_harness.exe --tsrport      DLSS SR's vectors from the filter against the same made on the CPU, and their GPU time
dlssnr_harness.exe --tupscale     the resize shaders and the mpv prescalers on film frames
dlssnr_harness.exe --tupscalecost what EfRLFN costs at film sizes
dlssnr_harness.exe --tchroma      the chroma upsamplers on 4:2:0 made from film frames
dlssnr_harness.exe --tmpvport     the filter's prescaler runner against the harness's

```

`--tframes N` sets the frames per run; `--tstrong` uses the strongest network settings;
`--timage <file>` picks the photo for `--teffect`, `--tflow` and `--tstab` (a Windows 11
wallpaper by default). `--nonr` skips the DLSS 5 NR session for the suites that do not need
it, `--srdll <path>` points at `nvngx_dlss.dll`, and `--srrefs N` limits `--tsrq`,
`--tsrstill` and `--tsrport` to the first N references. `--tupscale`, `--tchroma`,
`--tmpvport` and the three DLSS SR suites read 4K film frames from
`tools/dlssnr_probe/upscale_refs/`. `--tupscale` also runs the mpv shaders it finds
translated under `tools/dlssnr_probe/upscalers/hlsl/` (`Shaders/mpv/mpv_shaders.py` puts them
there); the three the filter embeds need nothing but the build.

A neural upscaler, EfRLFN, was measured too and not integrated: 922 ms per 1080p frame on the
RTX 3050 with DirectML (`--tupscalecost`), and no better than Catmull-Rom or Lanczos on clean
film frames (`--tupscale`).

**`vp_rebuild_test.exe`** — checks that rebuilding the hardware video processor keeps the
picture, which is what used to show a green frame when DLSS was toggled while paused.

**`shader444_test.exe`** — compiles the chroma pass the filter generates for *Replace VP chroma
upsampling*, for each source format and each chroma method, since a compute shader has rules a
pixel shader has not. One that does not compile leaves the picture to the video processor
without a word, so nothing on screen says it happened.

**`vp444_probe.exe`** — asks the driver, through the renderer's own `CD3D11VP`, what the
video processor really does with each input format: which it takes, how its conversion
compares, and how much enabling Super Resolution, RTX Video HDR or deinterlacing changes the
picture, for 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 alike. `--film` runs it on film frames, `--pack` checks the
packing into AYUV and Y410 is exact, `--views` which bind flags still make an input view, and
`--hdrconv` which conversions the processor declares. The numbers quoted in the chroma section
above come from it.

**`freeze_dump.exe`** — run against a player that hangs (by name, by process id, or with no
argument at all), it asks Windows what every thread is waiting for, names any cycle as the
deadlock it is, and walks each stack with the filter's own names, from the pdb beside its .ax.
It reads and changes nothing, and writes `freeze_dump.txt` beside itself.

**`playback_test.exe`** — plays a synthetic film through the built x64 filter
(`_bin\Filter_x64\MpcVideoRenderer64.ax`) in a DirectShow graph, in a window, on the system
clock: DLSS off, DLSS SR, and DLSS 5 NR with SR, render ahead off and on. It reads the filter's
statistics ten times a second and reports the Sync offset, skipped and late pictures, and how
long pause, run and stop take; it fails when a state change takes more than a second. The
settings go to the filter for the run only, nothing is saved.

With `--scalers` it plays a still NV12 picture through the shader video processor with each
Upscaling and Chroma upsampling method in turn, reports what the statistics say they did and
cost, saves each displayed picture as `scalers_<n>.bmp` and compares them with the Catmull-Rom
one — a wrong pass shows up as a large difference. It also saves the same picture with the
statistics drawn over it, as `scalers_<n>_stats.bmp`, which is how the overlay's box is checked.
`--vp` leaves the hardware video processor the formats it is set for, to see it convert.

`--mainpage` and `--dlsspage` show a property page of the built filter for a few seconds and
save it as `proppage.bmp`, without a player; `--click <id>` then clicks one control and saves
the page again as `proppage_clicked.bmp`, which is how the greying is checked. `--mainpage`
also prints the *Chroma upsampling* and *Upscaling* lists as the page really built them, each
entry with the number it carries and which one is selected: a picture says nothing about that,
and the order of those lists is the point of them. `--chroma` plays one picture, a 4K film
frame halved, as 4:2:0 and as 4:4:4 at its own size, and measures what each chroma upsampler
rebuilds against the 4:4:4 one — every method the list offers, and each of them again through
the video processor with *Replace VP chroma upsampling* on, which is where a chroma pass that
leaves a render target behind shows up as a colour cast. The hardware processor's own chroma
comes out between Nearest and Bilinear, 1.7 dB under Catmull-Rom along luma edges.

`--toggle` changes one setting at a time while the film plays, from the thread that owns the
window as the player does, and checks three things: that the call comes back, that the
renderer goes on drawing, and that **the screen itself keeps moving**. The last one is not the
same as the others: a swap chain can present picture after picture, in time and without error,
into a window the desktop no longer updates, and nothing inside the filter can see it. The
suite watches the desktop through the duplication API, which shows what Windows really
composes. A call that does not come back in time prints every thread's stack and what each is
waiting for. `--gpu` sends the pictures as D3D11 textures, the way a hardware decoder does,
which makes the renderer run on the decoder's device; `--hdr` asks for HDR passthrough, which
only means something while the desktop is already in HDR, and never switches the display
itself; `--switch` walks the video processor's own extras -- RTX Video HDR, Super Resolution --
as the chroma moves to the shaders and back; `--file <path> [--seek <seconds>]` plays a real
film through LAV Splitter and LAV Video, the ones the installed player carries, with the sound
rendered silently so the graph is clocked as the player clocks it. The program
carries a Windows 10 manifest, without which the version helpers answer 6.2 and the pages grey
what the player would not; it turns HDR passthrough off for its runs in exchange, since the
filter may then switch the display's own HDR state, which is not what is being measured.
